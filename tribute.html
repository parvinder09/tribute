							<h4> Quotes by APJ:</h4>
							<ul>
							<li>
							You have to dream before your dreams can come true.
							</li>
							<li>Man needs his difficulties because they are necessary to enjoy success.
							</li>
							<li>Great dreams of great dreamers are always transcended.</li>
							<li>To succeed in your mission, you must have single-minded devotion to your goal.</li>
							<li>We should not give up and we should not allow the problem to defeat us.</li>
							<li>Those who cannot work with their hearts achieve but a hollow, half-hearted success that breeds bitterness all around.</li>
							<li>In India we only read about death, sickness, terrorism, crime.</li>
							<li>We have not invaded anyone. We have not conquered anyone. We have not grabbed their land, their culture, their history and tried to enforce our way of life on them.</li>
							<li>Look at the sky. We are not alone. The whole universe is friendly to us and conspires only to give the best to those who dream and work.</li>
							<li>Be more dedicated to making solid achievements than in running after swift but synthetic happiness.</li>
							</li>
							</ul>
							</li>
